# Basic C Programming Tutorial
## Chapter 9.Operators
* An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions.
### Types of operators:

 Arithmetic Operators

 Relational Operators

 Logical Operators

 Bitwise Operators

 Assignment Operators

 Misc Operators

## Arithmetic Operators:

### Example with Description:

Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:

##Operators: 

        + Adds two operands--> A + B = 30

        - Subtracts second operand from the first--> A - B = -10

        * Multiplies both operands--> A * B = 200

        / Divides numerator by de-numerator--> B / A = 2

        % Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division--> B % A = 0

        ++ Increment operator increases the integer value by one--> A++ = 11

        -- Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one--> A-- = 9

#### Example Program:

#include <stdio.h>

main()

{

int a = 21;

int b = 10;

int c ;

c = a + b;

printf("Line 1 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a - b;

printf("Line 2 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a * b;

printf("Line 3 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a / b;

printf("Line 4 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a % b;

printf("Line 5 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a++;

printf("Line 6 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a--;

printf("Line 7 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

}

#### Result:

Line 1 - Value of c is 31

Line 2 - Value of c is 11

Line 3 - Value of c is 210

Line 4 - Value of c is 2

Line 5 - Value of c is 1

Line 6 - Value of c is 21

Line 7 - Value of c is 22

## Relational Operators:

### Example with Description:

Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:

##Operators:

        == Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If yes, then the condition becomes true--> (A == B) is not true.

        != Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. If the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true--> (A != B) is true.
        
        > Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true--> (A > B) is note.
       
        < Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true--> (A < B) is true.
        
        >= Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true-->(A >= B) is not true.
       
        <= Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand. If yes, then the condition becomes true-->(A <= B) is true.

### Example Program:

#include <stdio.h>

main()

{

int a = 21;

int b = 10;

int c ;

if( a == b )

{

printf("Line 1 - a is equal to b\n" );

}

else

{

printf("Line 1 - a is not equal to b\n" );

}

if ( a < b )

{

printf("Line 2 - a is less than b\n" );

}

else

{

printf("Line 2 - a is not less than b\n" );

}

if ( a > b )

{

printf("Line 3 - a is greater than b\n" );

}

else

{

printf("Line 3 - a is not greater than b\n" );

}

/* Lets change value of a and b */

a = 5;

b = 20;

if ( a <= b )

{

printf("Line 4 - a is either less than or equal to b\n" );

}

if ( b >= a )

{

printf("Line 5 - b is either greater than or equal to b\n" );

}

}

### Result:

Line 1 - a is not equal to b

Line 2 - a is not less than b

Line 3 - a is greater than b

Line 4 - a is either less than or equal to b

Line 5 - b is either greater than or equal to b

## Logical Operators:
### Example with Description:

 Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then:

### Operators:

        && Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true--> (A && B) is false.

        || Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then the condition--> (A || B) is true.

        ! Called Logical NOT Operator. It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make it false--> !(A && B) is true.

### Example Program:

#include <stdio.h>

main()

{

int a = 5;

int b = 20;

int c ;

if ( a && b )

{

printf("Line 1 - Condition is true\n" );

}

if ( a || b )

{

printf("Line 2 - Condition is true\n" );

}

/* lets change the value of a and b */

a = 0;

b = 10;

if ( a && b )

{

printf("Line 3 - Condition is true\n" );

}

else

{

printf("Line 3 - Condition is not true\n" );

}

if ( !(a && b) )

{

printf("Line 4 - Condition is true\n" );

}

}

### Result:

Line 1 - Condition is true

Line 2 - Condition is true

Line 3 - Condition is not true

Line 4 - Condition is true

## Bitwise Operators:

Bitwise operators work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation.

### Example with Description:

Assume A = 60 and B = 13; in binary format, they will be as follows:

A = 0011 1100

B = 0000 1101

### Operators:

        & Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands--> (A & B) = 12, i.e., 0000 1100
       
        | Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand--> (A | B) = 61, i.e., 0011 1101
        
        ^ Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both-->(A ^ B) = 49, i.e., 0011 0001
        
        ~ Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits--> (~A ) = -61, i.e., 1100 0011 in 2's complement form.
       
        << Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand--> A << 2 = 240, i.e., 1111 0000
        
        >> Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand--> A >> 2 = 15, i.e., 0000 1111

### Example Program:

#include <stdio.h>

main()

{

unsigned int a = 60; /* 60 = 0011 1100 */

unsigned int b = 13; /* 13 = 0000 1101 */

int c = 0;

c = a & b; /* 12 = 0000 1100 */

printf("Line 1 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a | b; /* 61 = 0011 1101 */

printf("Line 2 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a ^ b; /* 49 = 0011 0001 */

printf("Line 3 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = ~a; /*-61 = 1100 0011 */

printf("Line 4 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a << 2; /* 240 = 1111 0000 */

printf("Line 5 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

c = a >> 2; /* 15 = 0000 1111 */

printf("Line 6 - Value of c is %d\n", c );

}

### Result:

Line 1 - Value of c is 12

Line 2 - Value of c is 61

Line 3 - Value of c is 49

Line 4 - Value of c is -61

Line 5 - Value of c is 240

Line 6 - Value of c is 15

## Assignment Operators:

### Example with Description:

####Operators:

        = Simple assignment operator. Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand--> C = A + B will assign the value of A + B to C

        += Add AND assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand--> C += A is equivalent to C = C + A

        -= Subtract AND assignment operator. It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand--> C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A
        
        *= Multiply AND assignment operator. It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand--> C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A
        
        /= Divide AND assignment operator. It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand--> C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A
        
        %= Modulus AND assignment operator. It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand--> C %= A is equivalent to C = C % A
        
        <<= Left shift AND assignment operator--> C <<= 2 is same as C = C << 2
        
        >>= Right shift AND assignment operator--> C >>= 2 is same as C = C >> 2
       
        &= Bitwise AND assignment operator--> C &= 2 is same as C = C & 2
        
        ^= Bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator--> C ^= 2 is same as C = C ^ 2
        
        |= Bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator-->C |= 2 is same as C = C | 2

### Example Program:

#include <stdio.h>

main()

{

int a = 21;

int c ;

c = a;

printf("Line 1 - = Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c += a;

printf("Line 2 - += Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c -= a;

printf("Line 3 - -= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c *= a;

printf("Line 4 - *= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c /= a;

printf("Line 5 - /= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c = 200;

c %= a;

printf("Line 6 - %= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c <<= 2;

printf("Line 7 - <<= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c >>= 2;

printf("Line 8 - >>= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c &= 2;

printf("Line 9 - &= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c ^= 2;

printf("Line 10 - ^= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

c |= 2;

printf("Line 11 - |= Operator Example, Value of c = %d\n", c );

}

### Result:

Line 1 - = Operator Example, Value of c = 21

Line 2 - += Operator Example, Value of c = 42

Line 3 - -= Operator Example, Value of c = 21

Line 4 - *= Operator Example, Value of c = 441

Line 5 - /= Operator Example, Value of c = 21

Line 6 - %= Operator Example, Value of c = 11

Line 7 - <<= Operator Example, Value of c = 44

Line 8 - >>= Operator Example, Value of c = 11

Line 9 - &= Operator Example, Value of c = 2

Line 10 - ^= Operator Example, Value of c = 0

Line 11 - |= Operator Example, Value of c = 2

## Misc Operators ↦ sizeof & ternary

### Example with Description:

### Operators:
        sizeof() Returns the size of a variable. sizeof(a), where a is integer, will return 4.
        
        & Returns the address of a variable. &a; returns the actual address of the variable.
        
        * Pointer to a variable. *a;
        
        ? : Conditional Expression. If Condition is true ? then value X : otherwise value Y

#### Example Program:

#include <stdio.h>

main()

{

int a = 4;

short b;

double c;

int* ptr;

/* example of sizeof operator */

printf("Line 1 - Size of variable a = %d\n", sizeof(a) );

printf("Line 2 - Size of variable b = %d\n", sizeof(b) );

printf("Line 3 - Size of variable c= %d\n", sizeof(c) );

/* example of & and * operators */

ptr = &a; /* 'ptr' now contains the address of 'a'*/

printf("value of a is %d\n", a);

printf("*ptr is %d.\n", *ptr);

/* example of ternary operator */

a = 10;

b = (a == 1) ? 20: 30;

printf( "Value of b is %d\n", b );

b = (a == 10) ? 20: 30;

printf( "Value of b is %d\n", b );

}

### Result:

value of a is 4

*ptr is 4.

Value of b is 30

Value of b is 20

## Operators Precedence in C
##### Hint

        VBODMAS

Here,

        V for Virnaculum or Bar

        B for Bracket

        O for of

        D for Division

        M for Multiplication

        A for Addition

        S for Subtraction

### Example with Description:

For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has a higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.

### Operator Precedence:
        Postfix () [] -> . ++ - - Left to right
        Unary + - ! ~ ++ - - (type)* & sizeof Right to left
        Multiplicative * / % Left to right
        Additive + - Left to right
        Shift << >> Left to right
        Relational < <= > >= Left to right
        Equality == != Left to right
        Bitwise AND & Left to right
        Bitwise XOR ^ Left to right
        Bitwise OR | Left to right
        Logical AND && Left to right
        Logical OR || Left to right
        Conditional ?: Right to left
        Assignment = += -= *= /= %=>>= <<= &= ^= |= Right to left
        Comma , Left to right

### Example Program:

#include <stdio.h>

main()

{

int a = 20;

int b = 10;

int c = 15;

int d = 5;

int e;

e = (a + b) * c / d; // ( 30 * 15 ) / 5

printf("Value of (a + b) * c / d is : %d\n", e );

e = ((a + b) * c) / d; // (30 * 15 ) / 5

printf("Value of ((a + b) * c) / d is : %d\n" , e );

e = (a + b) * (c / d); // (30) * (15/5)

printf("Value of (a + b) * (c / d) is : %d\n", e );

e = a + (b * c) / d; // 20 + (150/5)

printf("Value of a + (b * c) / d is : %d\n" , e );

return 0;

}

### Result:

Value of (a + b) * c / d is : 90

Value of ((a + b) * c) / d is : 90

Value of (a + b) * (c / d) is : 90

Value of a + (b * c) / d is : 50

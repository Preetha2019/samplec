# Basic C Programming Tutorial

## Chapter 6. Variables

## Definitions Versus Declaration:

* When a data object is declared, only its attributes are made known to the compiler. When an object is defined, not only are its attributes made known, but also the object is created. For a variable, memory is allocated to hold it; for a function, its code is compiled into an object module.
  
* _DEFINITION__= DECLARATION+ SPACE RESERVATION
  
##### Following are examples of declarations:

* extern int a;//Declaring a variable without defining
  
* struct_tag Example (int a;int b;};//Declaring a struct
  
* int myfunc{int a, int b};//Declaring a function
  
##### Following are examples of definitions:

* int a;

* int b=0;

* int myfunc{int a, int b}{return a+b;}

* struct_tag Example example;

#### Lvalues and Rvalues in C

##### lvalue : 

* Expressions that refer to a memory location are called "lvalue" expressions. An lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.

##### Example:

int g = 20; // valid statement

##### rvalue : 

* The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which means an rvalue may appear on the right-hand side but not on the left-hand side of an assignment.

##### Example:

10 = 20; // invalid statement; would generate compile-time error

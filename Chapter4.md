# Basic C Programming Tutorial 
## Chapter 4.Basic Syntax
#### Token in C:
* a keyword, 
* an identifier, 
* a constant,
* a string literal, 
* a symbol.
##### Semicolons:
* The semicolon is a statement terminator.
####### Example:

printf("Hello, World! \n");

return 0;

##### Comments:
* Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. 
* They start with /* and terminate with the characters */.
###### Example:

/* my first program in C */ 

##### Identifiers:
* A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other userdefined
item. 
* An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore ‘_’ followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
* C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers.
* C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. 
##### Keywords:
* The following list shows the reserved words in C. 

auto, else, long, switch,
break, enum, register, typedef,
case, extern, return, union,
char, float, short, unsigned,
const, for, signed, void,
continue, goto, sizeof, volatile,
default, if, static, while,
do, int, struct, _Packed,
double

* These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
##### Whitespace in C
* A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
* Although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.

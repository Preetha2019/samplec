# Basic C Programming Tutorial
## Chapter 1. Overview
* C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. 
* C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
* In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
* The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons:

  Easy to learn

  Structured language

  It produces efficient programs

  It can handle low-level activities

  It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms

####  Facts about C
* C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.
* C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.
* The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).
* The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
* Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.
* Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
* Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.
#### Why Use C?
* C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. 
* C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language.
* _Some examples of the use of C might be:_

  Operating Systems

  Language Compilers

  Assemblers

  Text Editors

  Print Spoolers

  Network Drivers

  Modern Programs

  Databases

  Language Interpreters

  Utilities
 ### Applications of c:
 
 Mainly C language is used for _Desktop Develop Application_ and _System Software_.
 
 Some application of C language are given below:
 * Cprogramming language can be used to design the system software like operating system and compiler.
 * To develop application software like database and spread sheets.
 * For Develop _Graphical related application_ like _computer_ and _mobile games_.
 * To evaluate any kind of mathematical equation use c language.
 * C programming language can be used to design the compilers.
 * Unix Kernal is completely developed in C language.
 * For creating compilers of different language which can take input from other language and convert it into lower level machine development language.
 * C programming language can be used to design operating system.
 * C programming language can be used to design Network Devices.
 ##### Hint:
 
   C program should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c. You can
<<<<<<< HEAD
use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.
=======
use "vi", "vim" or any other text editor to write your C program into a file.

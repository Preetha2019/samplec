# Basic C Programming Tutorial
## Chapter 8. Storage Class
* A storage class represents the visibility and a location of a variable.
#### A Storage Class used to define the following things:
* The variable scope.
* The location whether the variable will be stored.
* The initialized value of a variable.
* A lifetime of a variable.
#### There are four types of standard storage class in C:

* auto

* extern

* static

* register

### Auto Storage Class:
* Auto stands for automatic storage class. 
* A variable is in auto storage class by default if it is not explicitly specified.
#### Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main( )

{

  auto int j = 1;

  {

    auto int j= 2;

    {

      auto int j = 3;

      printf ( " %d ", j);

    }

    printf ( "\t %d ",j);

  }

  printf( "%d\n", j);
  
  }

#### OUTPUT:

 3 2 1 

 ### Extern Storage Class:
  * Extern storage class is used when we have global functions or variables which are shared between two or more files.
  * These variables are accessible throughout the program.
 #### Example:
 
  First File: main.c

#include <stdio.h>

extern i;

main()

 {

   printf("value of the external integer is = %d\n", i);

   return 0;

   }

Second File:original.c

#include <stdio.h>

i=48;

#### Result:

 value of the external integer is = 48

 ### Static Storage Class:
 * The static variables are used within function/ file as local static variables. 
 * They can also be used as a global variable.
 * Static local variable is a local variable that retains and stores its value between function calls or block and remains visible only to the function or block in which it is defined.
 * Static global variables are global variables visible only to the file in which it is declared.
 ##### Hint:
 *  static variable has a default initial value zero and is initialized only once in its lifetime.
 #### Example:

#include <stdio.h> /* function declaration */

void next(void);

static int counter = 7; /* global variable */

main()

 {

 while(counter<10)

  {

      next();

      counter++; 
      
        }

return 0;

}

void next( void ) {    /* function definition */

   static int iteration = 13; /* local static variable */

   iteration ++;

   printf("iteration=%d and counter= %d\n", iteration, counter);
   
   }

Result:

iteration=14 and counter= 7

iteration=15 and counter= 8

iteration=16 and counter= 9
### Register Storage Class:
* You can use the register storage class when you want to store local variables within functions or blocks in CPU registers instead of RAM to have quick access to these variables.
#### Example:

#include <stdio.h> /* function declaration */

main()

 {

register int  weight;

int *ptr=&weight ;/*it produces an error when the compilation occurs ,we cannot get a memory location when dealing with CPU register*/}

}

#### OUTPUT:

error: address of register variable 'weight' requested

# Basic C Programming Tutorial

## Chapter 2.Environment Setup

Here, environmental variable is a dynamic object on a computer containing an editable value, which may be used by one or more software programs in windows. Environment variables help programs know what directory to install file, where to store temporary files and where to find user defined settings. In simple, Environment variables contain configuration values for entire system as well as current user. 

### Local Environment Setup

There are two software tools needs for environment setup on your computer

(a) Text Editor 

(b) The C Compiler.

#### Text Editor:

* It used to type and edit program.

* Examples of a editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.

* The files we create with our editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. 

#### The C Compiler:

* The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. 

* The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.

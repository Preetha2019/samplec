# Notes:

## Chapter 1. Overview

* C is a high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie in 1972. 

* In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C.

* The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).

* Most popular Linux OS have been written in C.

* C program should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c".

* C used in operating systems, language compilers, assemblers, text editors, print spoolers, network drivers, modern programs, databases, language interpreters.

    Here, 
            * Operating system is an interface between a user and hardware. It is a system software which performs all basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output and controlling peripheral devices i.e disk drives and printers.  
            
            * Compiler converts programming language into machine language.

            * Assemblers converts assembly language into machine language.

            * Text editors focusing on editing functions for plain text.

            * Print spoolers program allows a user to delete a print job being processed or otherwise manage the print jobs currently waiting to be printed. If a computer is having difficulty sending a print job to a printer, the cause of the problem may be the print spooler service.
            
            * Network driver used to enables a network device to communicate between the computer and operating system as well as with other network computers and network devices.
            
            * Language interpreters is the another way to run the program. For long program, programmer choices interpreter rather than compiler,because here there is no need of compilation stage. So, it consumes less time and also, there is no need to convert machine code, it only converts into intermediate form.

# Basic C Programming Tutorial
## Chapter 2.Environment Setup
### Local Environment Setup

There are two software tools needs for environment setup on your computer

(a) Text Editor 

(b) The C Compiler.

#### Text Editor
* This will be used to type your program.
* Examples of a few editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.
* The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems.
* For example, _Notepad_ will be used on Windows, and _vim or vi_ can be used on Windows as well as on _Linux or UNIX._
* The files you create with your editor are called the source files and they contain the program source codes. 
* The source files for C programs are typically named with the extension ".c".
* Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.
#### The C Compiler
* The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. 
* It needs to be "compiled" into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions given.
* The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. 
* The most frequently used and free available compiler is the GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective operating systems.
